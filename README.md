## About

This website is designed to showcase my work and is an outlet for my design and development work as well as a place to share my work experience. \
The entire website is built by me and uses `eunoia`, an open source react component library designed by me and available via `npm` at [npmjs.com/eunoia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eunoia). It also uses `github-contributions-counter` a tool built by me allowing uses to get their Github contributions history. This is also available via `npm` at [npmjs.com/github-contributions-counter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-contributions-counter).
