It can be used on the server, or client-side. I created, and open-sourced\n        the package because I wanted a way to share my contribution history on my website, and I\n        felt that the library could be useful for other developers who wanted to access the\n        contribution history for various users via a simple, single-function interface. The package\n        allows you to get the contributions history for a user based on the last year, the total\n        contributions of the user, or the contribution history categorized by year.

Since github does not support contribution history via their API, the only option is\n        to scrape a user’s public github profile for their contributions history. The async package\n        uses axios to make a simple get request to a users github profile, using a proxy for usage\n        in the browser. It then parses the HTML retrieved from the get-request using{' '}\n        <code>cheerio.js</code>, creating a virtual DOM object, and accesses DOM attributes relating\n        to contribution history. After some sanitizing, and cleanup, the results are returned\n        asynchronously in the form of an array of objects containing contribution history for the\n        user!

In the interrupt\n        the code checks if the current time corresponds to the internal timer scaled to 30 seconds\n        using the\n        <code> ISR(TIMER2_OVF_vect)</code> interrupt. If the time matches, it will update the\n        unlocked state. if all states are true then the safe will unlock by activating a servo\n        motor.

This website was born out of both user feedback from my previous\n        portfolios and a need for a more practical, scalable website, where projects could be easily\n        added or removed as my experience and portfolio grows. My previous websites were strong in\n        some areas and weak in others. For example, while my latest portfolio was advanced from a\n        development standpoint, and showed of my skill and ability to work with animations and\n        experimental designs, it was “quite experimental” and was not designed to fill the role of a\n        portfolio, it featured little actual work, and was a simple single-page application. From\n        user testing and feedback, I discovered that my winter 2020 website polled well with\n        developers, but poorly with designers. In addition to this, previous portfolios had\n        complicated design structures or were written in vanilla javascript making scalability\n        challenging. This website aims to confront the various design and infrastructure concerns by\n        providing a stable, scalable and athestitically balanced website showcasing my design {`&`}{' '}\n        development projects, as well as my industry experience.\n      </Text>,\n    ],\n  },\n  section2: {\n    title: `This Website`,\n    text: [\n      <Text padding={5} wide>\n        Built with React.js, this is my latest website {`&`} portfolio.

There were some interesting\n        design constraints that were established to ensure flexibility in the usage of the logo. A\n        minimal and contrast-heavy design was decided upon so that the logo could be made into a\n        stamp, and minimal colors were to be used to reduce packaging costs. More interestingly a\n        circular shape was agreed to be the most desirable because it could be placed on the top of\n        circula jars and other containers without disrupting the container profile.

The second Was a graphical representation of an acorn, coming from\n        the oak tree, which is commonly associated with the month of June. used in the name\n        Junestreat. The final design, and the direction that was ultimately settled upon was a\n        curricular logo, with a sketch of a pecan in the middle, symbolic of the types of nuts used\n        by Evelina in her delicious recipes.
