Eunoia, the design system, was created and is used to convey\n        a sense of appreciation for traditional web design, while still maintaining and exploring\n        innovating design methods and leveraging new technology. The system is designed, and\n        developed by me, and is open sourced under an MIT licence, meaning anyone is welcome to use\n        my design components. The design system is built with accessibility in mind and features\n        high-contrast components. It is built on{' '}\n        <a href={materialDesignURL}>Google’s material design</a> system. I chose to do this for a\n        number of reasons. Based on the design principle of Jakob’s Law, which states that since\n        users will on average spend most of their time (90%) on other sites, thus users would expect\n        my site to work in a similar fashion. Leveraging best practices of material design ensures a\n        higher sense of comfort amongst users using the site.

Components are built to react and are purely functional in\n        nature meaning that you don’t need to worry about managing the internal state of a component\n        since it is determined simply by its props. The components are in part built using\n        <code>styled-components</code> and thus are extensible and can have their styles overridden.\n        The library is <a href={eunoiaNpmURL}>downloadable via npm</a>, and components can be\n        previewed via <a href={eunoiaStorybookURL}>storybook</a>.

It can be used on the server, or client-side. I created, and open-sourced\n        the package because I wanted a way to share my contribution history on my website, and I\n        felt that the library could be useful for other developers who wanted to access the\n        contribution history for various users via a simple, single-function interface. The package\n        allows you to get the contributions history for a user based on the last year, the total\n        contributions of the user, or the contribution history categorized by year.

Since github does not support contribution history via their API, the only option is\n        to scrape a user’s public github profile for their contributions history. The async package\n        uses axios to make a simple get request to a users github profile, using a proxy for usage\n        in the browser. It then parses the HTML retrieved from the get-request using{' '}\n        <code>cheerio.js</code>, creating a virtual DOM object, and accesses DOM attributes relating\n        to contribution history. After some sanitizing, and cleanup, the results are returned\n        asynchronously in the form of an array of objects containing contribution history for the\n        user!

Thonk.js is an open-source node.js package written by me (in materials\n        chemistry class instead of actually doing chemistry) that uses natural language processing\n        to replace all the appropriate words in a given string with either, thonk, thonked, or\n        thonking.

In the interrupt\n        the code checks if the current time corresponds to the internal timer scaled to 30 seconds\n        using the\n        <code> ISR(TIMER2_OVF_vect)</code> interrupt. If the time matches, it will update the\n        unlocked state. if all states are true then the safe will unlock by activating a servo\n        motor.

This website was born out of both user feedback from my previous\n        portfolios and a need for a more practical, scalable website, where projects could be easily\n        added or removed as my experience and portfolio grows. My previous websites were strong in\n        some areas and weak in others. For example, while my latest portfolio was advanced from a\n        development standpoint, and showed of my skill and ability to work with animations and\n        experimental designs, it was “quite experimental” and was not designed to fill the role of a\n        portfolio, it featured little actual work, and was a simple single-page application. From\n        user testing and feedback, I discovered that my winter 2020 website polled well with\n        developers, but poorly with designers. In addition to this, previous portfolios had\n        complicated design structures or were written in vanilla javascript making scalability\n        challenging. This website aims to confront the various design and infrastructure concerns by\n        providing a stable, scalable and athestitically balanced website showcasing my design {`&`}{' '}\n        development projects, as well as my industry experience.\n      </Text>,\n    ],\n  },\n  section2: {\n    title: `This Website`,\n    text: [\n      <Text padding={5} wide>\n        Built with React.js, this is my latest website {`&`} portfolio.
