I created, and open-sourced\n        the package because I wanted a way to share my contribution history on my website, and I\n        felt that the library could be useful for other developers who wanted to access the\n        contribution history for various users via a simple, single-function interface. The package\n        allows you to get the contributions history for a user based on the last year, the total\n        contributions of the user, or the contribution history categorized by year. You can{' '}\n        <a href={githubContributionsCounterNpmURL}>download the package via NPM</a>, or{' '}\n        <a href={githubContributionsCounterCodeboxURL}>try it out via codebox</a>\n      </Text>,\n    ],\n  },\n  section2: {\n    title: `Development Process`,\n    text: [\n      <Text padding={5} wide>\n        The package is written in vanilla javascript and uses two external dependencies to extract\n        data. Since github does not support contribution history via their API, the only option is\n        to scrape a user’s public github profile for their contributions history. The async package\n        uses axios to make a simple get request to a users github profile, using a proxy for usage\n        in the browser. It then parses the HTML retrieved from the get-request using{' '}\n        <code>cheerio.js</code>, creating a virtual DOM object, and accesses DOM attributes relating\n        to contribution history. After some sanitizing, and cleanup, the results are returned\n        asynchronously in the form of an array of objects containing contribution history for the\n        user!

It can also\n        be described as the emotion felt when something goes hilariously awry or the action of\n        thinking strangely. Thonk.js is an open-source node.js package written by me (in materials\n        chemistry class instead of actually doing chemistry) that uses natural language processing\n        to replace all the appropriate words in a given string with either, thonk, thonked, or\n        thonking. This is known as “thonkifying the strings”. You can also use the Chonk method\n        provided in thonk.js to “chonkify a string”. A chonk refers to a large but cute animal, most\n        commonly a cat. More surprisingly, after I open-sourced the package, it now has hundreds of\n        downloads via npm.

To open the safe you must\n        “scream” at the safe at the correct times (in seconds) corresponding to the combination that\n        you set. if the screaming times are correct, the safe will open! The safe uses an arduino\n        uno, a liquid-crystal display, a sound sensor, a number of different buttons,\n        potentiometers, and a step-motor to control the safe’s open and closed states.

In the interrupt\n        the code checks if the current time corresponds to the internal timer scaled to 30 seconds\n        using the\n        <code> ISR(TIMER2_OVF_vect)</code> interrupt. If the time matches, it will update the\n        unlocked state. if all states are true then the safe will unlock by activating a servo\n        motor.

This website was born out of both user feedback from my previous\n        portfolios and a need for a more practical, scalable website, where projects could be easily\n        added or removed as my experience and portfolio grows. My previous websites were strong in\n        some areas and weak in others. For example, while my latest portfolio was advanced from a\n        development standpoint, and showed of my skill and ability to work with animations and\n        experimental designs, it was “quite experimental” and was not designed to fill the role of a\n        portfolio, it featured little actual work, and was a simple single-page application. From\n        user testing and feedback, I discovered that my winter 2020 website polled well with\n        developers, but poorly with designers. In addition to this, previous portfolios had\n        complicated design structures or were written in vanilla javascript making scalability\n        challenging. This website aims to confront the various design and infrastructure concerns by\n        providing a stable, scalable and athestitically balanced website showcasing my design {`&`}{' '}\n        development projects, as well as my industry experience.\n      </Text>,\n    ],\n  },\n  section2: {\n    title: `This Website`,\n    text: [\n      <Text padding={5} wide>\n        Built with React.js, this is my latest website {`&`} portfolio. It uses{' '}\n        <Link to=\"/eunoia\">eunoia</Link>, my open-source design system as it’s infrastructure\n        backbone, as well as Google’s Material Design component library to deliver an accessible and\n        simple user experience. The website’s navigation system uses <code>react-router-dom</code>{' '}\n        and is built on stateless functional components allowing web pages and articles to be built\n        in a matter of minutes. This holds many advantages, particularly when it comes to design\n        changes, since a single design change will be automatically propagated throughout the\n        website. Images are delivered via CDN to increase load times, and large asset imports are\n        lazy-rendered. The website is deployed via github-actions and hosted on firebase.\n      </Text>,\n    ],\n  },\n  section3: {\n    title: `A History of Design & Development…`,\n    text: [\n      <Text padding={5} wide>\n        It was a journey of ups and downs reaching this particular website. My first websites were\n        hosted on github pages and were written in vanilla javascript using bootstrap. As I fell in\n        love with react, I started experimenting with react single-page websites and my later\n        websites and portfolio were built in react. As I began to get more comfortable with React I\n        began using design tools such as Adobe XD, and development libraries like{' '}\n        <code>styled-components</code>\n        and anime.js to showcase clean user experiences on my website. Over time, my different\n        websites have served as timestamps showing my growth as both a developer and designer, and\n        remain as a symbol for where I have come from, and a spotlight for where I am going.\n      </Text>,\n    ],\n  },\n}\n","// react\nimport React, {Fragment} from 'react'\n// components\nimport { Grid } from '@material-ui/core'\nimport { Menu, Button } from
